# README

This open source project is built on the SixTasks methodology. For more information on how the SixTasks method works, please refer to the [documentation](https://ohp.bearblog.dev/six-tasks-productivity-method/).

### Keep it simple
While developing we will keep things simple. So, no fancy style sheets, decorators, or functionality. Keep
it to the most essential. Which basically is Add, Edit, Delete. It's not about being fancy, its doing the right things. As __Margaret Theatcher__ said it so nicely.

> Plan your work for today and every day, then work your plan.
